        <h1>The Case of the Lost Ledger</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">From the desk of Sir Robert Peel<br>Hampton Manor - August 14th, 1839</p>

        <p>Dear Inspector,</p>

        <p>My name is <strong>Sir Robert Peel</strong>. A long time ago, I helped create something very important—the police force. That's why, even today, officers are sometimes called "Bobbies" or "Peelers".</p>

        <p>I also protected something very secret: a book known as <strong>The Ledger</strong>. Inside it were the names of undercover agents, mysterious operations, and the private dealings of some very powerful families—secrets they'd rather the world never saw.</p>

        <p>To keep it safe, I hid the Ledger in a place I trusted more than anywhere: <em>Hampton Manor</em>, my family's old home. But then... it vanished. For over 150 years, no one knew what happened to it.</p>

        <p><strong>Until now.</strong></p>

        <p>Strange things have started to happen. An old envelope has been found. A cipher has reappeared. And it seems that these powerful families have discovered the truth: <strong>the Ledger is here.</strong></p>

        <p>And they are coming to find it.</p>

        <p>That's why I need you. The race is on. There are clues to follow, codes to crack, and sweet rewards for the sharpest minds. Some messages will be hidden. Some may be heard through secret voices. Others may appear only with special tools.</p>

        <p><strong>You are not just a guest today—you are an Inspector of the Realm.</strong></p>

        <p>Are you ready to uncover the truth before it disappears forever? If so, read the secret below. Your first clue may be closer than you think...</p>

        <p>Good luck, Inspector. The case is now in your hands.</p>
